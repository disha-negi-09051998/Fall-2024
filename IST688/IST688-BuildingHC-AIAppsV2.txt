IST 688 – Building Human-Centered AI ApplicationsInstructor: Jeffrey S. Saltz					Office: 233 Hinds Hall					Email:	jsaltz@syr.edu		Office Hours:	TBDCourse Time: 	TBD					Classroom: 	TBDCourse Description:Learn to build Generative AI applications leveraging large language models. Through hands-on projects, students will use libraries and APIs to create conversational agents, Q&A bots, and goal-oriented assistants. Topics covered include prompt engineering, AI conversational memory, output evaluation, and responsible AI practices.Additional Course DescriptionThis hands-on course teaches techniques for developing and deploying intelligent applications powered by large language models. Students will gain technical skills in prompt engineering, knowledge enhancement, conversational interface design, and evaluating model outputs. Responsible AI development practices related to ethics, bias mitigation, and accessibility will be woven throughout. No prior AI experience required. Final projects provide an opportunity to apply concepts to build an AI system.Prerequisite / Co-requisite:Knowledge of Python Programming or IST 687Audience: Any graduate student interested in understanding how to build and deploy Gen AI applications.Credits:3 creditsCourse Fees and/or CostsStudents will be responsible for LLM (ex. OpenAI) usage fees. This should be less than $10 (but it depends on how you are using the LLMs, and which LLMs you use).
Learning Objectives: After taking this course, students will be able to:  1. Explain concepts of large language models   2. Engineer effective prompts by applying techniques for tone, formatting, conditional logic, and mitigating risks.3. Develop applications leveraging large language model APIs and libraries.4. Implement memory and knowledge techniques such as retrieval augmentation to enhance application capabilities.5. Describe how applications can integrate LLMs (Large Language Models) with actions (such as sending an email) and external data stores (databases, data services)6. Build ethical AI systems by considering potential biases, harms, and real-world impacts.Required Texts / Supplies:There is no required textbook. However, the following will be helpful:1.

If you are registered but not present at the first class, you run the risk of being administratively deregistered from this course so that your seat can be given to a student on the wait list.● Late Policy for Assignments: To ensure fast return, all assignments should be submitted on time. One-hour grace period is given to accommodate any incidents around deadline. Late policy will be enforced starting from the second hour. You are free to discuss the assignments with your classmates, but you must write up the report all by yourself. Plagiarism cases will be reported to the university.● Communications: This course will use Blackboard as the main communication platforms for class exercises and notifications. Students are required to check their Blackboard accounts on a regular basis.
